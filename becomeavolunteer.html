                <h4 style="padding-bottom: 5px;"><b>Now accepting new volunteers!</b></h4>
                <p>Thank you for thinking of Wayside Waifs as the place to donate your time. The success of our Volunteer Program is not only measured by the dedication of time given by our remarkable volunteers, but by the selfless acts they contribute to make life better for homeless companion animals.</p>
                <p>You will find getting involved at Wayside Waifs to be one of the most rewarding experiences of your life. The first step towards becoming a volunteer is to sign up for a new volunteer information session, which are held weekly at Wayside Waifs Pet Adoption Campus. At our information sessions, you'll get a chance to learn more about the programs and services at Wayside Waifs, plus what you can expect as a volunteer. After some Q&A, you can decide if volunteering at Wayside Waifs is the right fit for you. A tour of the shelter is offered as well.</p>
                <p>Volunteers need to be at least 16 years old, or between the ages of 13-15 with a parent. Our regular volunteer program asks for a weekly commitment of at least three months. This provides the consistency our animals and volunteers need to succeed.</p>
                <p>If you are looking for a shorter donation of time, a group project or if you have teens under 13 who are interested in giving back, take a look at the additional opportunities that support our Mission and the animals in our care. These include our Group Service Projects, Kids in Action programming, donation drives and other projects.
                </p>

                <h5><b>Group Service Projects</b></h5>
                <p>Groups can be as small as four or as large as 20, depending on the current needs of the shelter. Our needs are continually changing, and we will typically know at the beginning of each month what group activities are available. All members of the group must be at least 16 years old. Groups with participants under the age of 16 should contact our Humane Education department about opportunities, and are encouraged to participate in the Service Projects listed below. </p>
                <p>Since special training is required to work with shelter animals, group acitivites do not include direct animal contact. Individuals interested in working directly with animals should complete an Adult Inquiry and be able to donate three months of weekly shifts. </p>
                <p>Groups often help with events, shelter clean up, and various support roles. For example, One of our regular needs at the shelter, that directly impacts the health and quality of life for our animals, is laundry. At any given time, we have 80-120 dogs housed at the shelter. EVERY animal deserves clean bedding. Keeping our laundry folded, sorted and in order is a challenging task..to say the least. In addition, our staff is providing new enrichment to our animals and this takes time. This enrichment provides outlets for mental stimulation to our dogs, two things that are necessary to a happy life.  </p>
                <p>We can also come to you! Would you like to learn more about Wayside Waifs, and how your organization can help homeless animals in the Kansas City area? A Wayside team member would be delighted to come to your organization to host a Lunchtime Learning Session. We will introduce you to all the great things happening at Wayside and how your company and employees can get involved.</p>
                <p>While we have many on-site volunteer opportunities, your organization can also benefit the animals by hosting a drive to collect needed shelter items or monetary donations. If you are interested, we are also able to schedule a tour when you drop off items and money raised.</p>
