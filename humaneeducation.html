                <p>Each year thousands of students receive a wide variety of quality programming delivered by Humane Educators and their companion animals! These programs are delivered in the greater Kansas City area for preschools, public and private elementary schools and a variety of community organizations.</p>
                <p>These intentionally designed programs help students develop empathy for all living beings, a trait vital to a student's success and predictor for future behaviors. We believe in the power of empathy to empower students to create positive change and impact for both the humans and animals in our community and beyond. </p>
                <p>While there is no set fee for our programming, we do ask that you consider making a donation. Your contributions allow us to continue these educational efforts.</p>
                <p><b>At this time we are not offering in person educational programs, however, many of our programs can be conducted virtually. If you are interested in scheduling a virtual presentation for your group, please email Karen at <a href="mailto:kwallace@waysidewaifs.org">kwallace@waysidewaifs.org</a> or John at <a href="mailto:jparker@waysidewaifs.org">jparker@waysidewaifs.org</a>.</b></p>

                <p>People who are abused by people often abuse animals. People who abuse animals often also abuse other people. And so the cycle goes. The connection between all forms of violence has been extensively studied and researched. In modern society, safety in schools, both physically and emotionally has been at the forefront of everyone's minds.</p>
                <p>Wayside Waifs directly addresses this fact by implementing the primary prevention program "No More Bullying!" This curriculum is the cornerstone of the Humane Education program, and is rooted in social and emotional learning practices. Students learn how to gain Self-Respect and Respect from others by learning about and <b>practicing</b> the following core character traits: Responsibility, Compassion, being Humane, Self-Control and Integrity. Studies prove that developing these principles in young people through the humane treatment of animals leads them to have greater empathy for human beings and is a higher predictor of success than IQ.</p>
                <p>If you would like the No More Bullying! program at your school or in your community but are outside of our presentation radius, the curriculum is available for purchase!

                <p>One of the most important ways students can stay safe around dogs is to understand and respect the way in which dogs communicate with us. During this bite prevention program, students will understand common body language in dogs (and people too!) and how to respond appropriately and respectfully. Students will also learn the proper way to greet a dog, what to do when approached by an unfamiliar dog and additional strategies to avoid being attacked by a dog.</p>
